In particular, as }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{respiratory pathogens, adding uncertainties to their future epidemic dynamics and their public health burden \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{baker2020impact}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
.
As }\DIFaddend interventions lifted, large heterogeneities in outbreak dynamics were observed across different pathogens in different countries\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(Figure 1), likely reflecting differences in NPI }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, with some pathogens exhibiting earlier and faster resurgences than others \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{gomez2021uncertain,koltai2022determinants,park2024predicting}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD

Heterogeneities in the overall reduction in transmission and the timing of re-emergence likely reflect differences in intervention }\DIFaddend patterns, pathogen characteristics, immigration/importation from other countries, and pre-pandemic pathogen dynamics \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

\DIFaddend Even though more than \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{four years have already }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{five years have }\DIFaddend passed since the emergence of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{COVID-19, current circulation patterns for many respiratory pathogens appear to be different from their }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{SARS-CoV-2, we still observe persistent changes in pathogen dynamics following the pandemic perturbations.
For example, compared to }\DIFaddend pre-pandemic, seasonal patterns, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{especially in Hong Kong and Korea:
some pathogens, such as human metapneumovirus and bocavirus in Korea , are circulating }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{human metapneumovirus in Korea seems to circulate }\DIFaddend at lower levels, whereas \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{other pathogens, such as }\DIFdelend RSV in Korea \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, seem }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{seems }\DIFaddend to exhibit different seasonality (Figure 1).
These observations \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{pose two fundamental questions for current and }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{suggest a possibility of a long-term change in pathogen dynamics following the pandemic perturbations, which might be driven by a long-term shift in either human behavior or population-level immunity \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{kissler2020projecting,baker2022long}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
.
For example, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 could have caused a long-term shift in population-level immunity through its interactions with other pathogens \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{swets2022sars}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
, especially with seasonal coronaviruses \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{kissler2020projecting,lin2022pre,murray2023impact}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
.
The possibility of a long-lasting impact of the pandemic perturbations poses an important question for }\DIFaddend future infectious disease dynamics: \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(1) can we learn about underlying pathogen characteristics, such as their transmissibility or duration of immunity, from re-emergence patterns? and (2) can we }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{can we }\DIFaddend predict whether and when other \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{respiratory }\DIFdelend pathogens will eventually return to their pre-pandemic dynamics?

.
Instead, we seek to characterize how fast (and whether) a pathogen returns to its pre-pandemic dynamics.
These two concepts have a subtle but important difference. 
For example, it took more than 3 years for human metapneumovirus to rebound in Hong Kong, but the observed epidemic patterns in 2024 appear similar to pre-pandemic seasonal means, suggesting a possible return to pre-pandemic dynamics, though confirmation may require multiple seasons (Figure 1).
Measuring this rate of return is useful because it allows us to quantify the ecological resilience of a host-pathogen system, which can inform responses to future interventions \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{To address this question, we propose a framework for }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{In this study, we lay out theoretical and statistical approaches to }\DIFaddend characterizing the resilience of a host-pathogen system based on how fast the system recovers from perturbation.

\section*{Conceptual introduction to pathogen resilience}

In \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the }\DIFaddend classical ecological literature, \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the }\DIFaddend resilience of an ecological system is measured by the rate at which the system returns to its reference state following a perturbation \citep{pimm1979structure, neubert1997alternatives,gunderson2000ecological,dakos2022ecological}.
This rate corresponds to the largest real part of the eigenvalues of the linearized system near equilibrium---here, we refer to this value as the \emph{intrinsic} resilience of the system, which represents the expected rate of return from perturbed states.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{However, respiratory pathogens often exhibit seasonal variation in transmission, meaning that }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{In practice, we rarely know the true model describing population-level dynamics of common respiratory pathogens, limiting our ability to infer }\DIFaddend the intrinsic resilience of a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{host-pathogen systemvaries across season.
Nonetheless}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{system.
Instead}\DIFaddend , we can \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{still }\DIFdelend measure the \emph{empirical} resilience of a host-pathogen system by looking at how fast the system returns to the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{pre-pandemic}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{pre-perturbation}\DIFaddend , endemic dynamics after \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{interventions are lifted.
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the perturbation has ended.
The COVID-19 pandemic provides a particularly useful example of a major perturbation, providing unique opportunities to measure the resilience of a host-pathogen system.
}\DIFaddend 

\DIFaddbegin \textbf{\DIFadd{Resilience of a single-strain system under a short-term perturbation.}} \DIFaddend As an example, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{consider an intervention that reduce }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{we begin with a simple Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible (SIRS) model with seasonally forced transmission and demography (i.e., birth and death).
The SIRS model is the simplest model that allows for the waning of immunity and is commonly used for modeling the dynamics of respiratory pathogens \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{dushoff2004dynamical}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
.
First, consider a pandemic perturbation that reduces }\DIFaddend transmission by 50\% for 6 months starting in 2020, which causes epidemic patterns to deviate from \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{its }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{their }\DIFaddend original stable annual cycle for a short period of time and eventually come back (Figure 2A).
To measure the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{empirical }\DIFdelend resilience of this system \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{empirically}\DIFaddend , we first need to be able to measure the distance from its pre-pandemic attractor\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, which is defined as a set of points in state space or phase plane that the system is pulled towards \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{hastings1993chaos}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend .
There are many \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{different }\DIFdelend ways we can measure the distance from \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the }\DIFaddend attractor, but for illustrative purposes, we choose one of the most parsimonious \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{approach}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{approaches}\DIFaddend : that is, we look at how the susceptible (S) and infected (I) populations change over time and measure the \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Euclidean }\DIFaddend distance on the SI phase plane\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, using the counterfactual unperturbed phase plane as a reference }\DIFaddend (Figure 2B\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{; Materials and Methods}\DIFaddend ).
In this simple case, the locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) fit indicates that the distance from \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{attractor decreases linearly on }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the attractor decreases exponentially (linearly on a log scale) on }\DIFaddend average (Figure 2C).
Furthermore, the overall rate of return \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{matches }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{approximates }\DIFaddend the intrinsic resilience of the seasonally unforced system (Figure 2C).

In such cases, we cannot know whether the pathogen will return to its original cycle or a different cycle until many years have passed\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{after the NPIs are lifted, meaning that }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, and }\DIFaddend we cannot measure the distance \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{against the new }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{to the new unknown }\DIFaddend attractor that the system \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{will }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{might }\DIFaddend eventually approach.
Nonetheless, we can still measure the distance \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{against the original, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{from the }\DIFaddend pre-pandemic attractor and ask how the distance changes over time (Figure 2E).
The LOESS fit suggests that the distance from the \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{pre-pandemic }\DIFaddend attractor will initially decrease exponentially on average (equivalently, linearly on a log scale) and eventually plateau (Figure 2F).
Here, a permanent 10\% reduction in transmission rate slows \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{down }\DIFdelend the system, which causes the distance from the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{attractor }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{pre-pandemic attractor initially }\DIFaddend to decrease at a slower rate (Figure 2F) than it would have otherwise \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in the absence of permanent transmission reduction }\DIFdelend (Figure 2C) \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{before plateauing at a fixed distance between the two attractors}\DIFaddend .
This example shows that resilience is not necessarily an intrinsic property of a specific pathogen.
Instead, pathogen resilience is a property of a specific attractor that a host-pathogen system approaches, which depends on both pathogen and host characteristics.

\DIFaddbegin \textbf{\DIFadd{Resilience of a single-strain system with long-term transients.}} \DIFaddend Finally, transient phenomena can \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{also }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{further }\DIFaddend complicate the picture (Figure 2G--I).
For example, a stage-structured model\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{for RSV }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, which accounts for reduction in secondary susceptibility, }\DIFaddend initially exhibits a stable annual cycle, but perturbations from \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{NPIs }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a 10\% reduction in transmission for 6 months }\DIFaddend cause the epidemic to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{exhibit }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{shift to }\DIFaddend biennial cycles (Figure 2G).
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Despite this biennial cycle, we see that the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The }\DIFaddend system eventually approaches the original pre-pandemic attractor (Figure 2H), suggesting that this biennial cycle is a transient\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{phenomenon}\DIFdelend .
The LOESS fit indicates that the distance from the attractor \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{will initially decrease }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{initially decreases }\DIFaddend exponentially at a rate that is consistent with the intrinsic resilience of the seasonally unforced \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{stage-structured }\DIFaddend system, but the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{rate of decrease slows down as the epidemic exhibits a biennial cycle }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{approach to the attractor slows down with the damped oscillations }\DIFaddend (Figure 2I).
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{In classical ecological theory, this }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This }\DIFaddend behavior is also referred to as a ghost attractor, which causes long transient dynamics and slow transitions \citep{hastings2018transient}.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{As we show in Supplementary Figure S1, strong }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Strong }\DIFaddend seasonal forcing in transmission can also lead to transient phenomena for a simple SIRS model, causing a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{slowing down of the system}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{slow return to pre-perturbation dynamics (Supplementary Figure S1)}\DIFaddend .

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{In Supplementary Materials, we also explore measuring }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \textbf{\DIFadd{Resilience of a two-strain system.}} \DIFadd{This empirical approach allows us to measure }\DIFaddend the resilience of a two-strain host-pathogen system \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{:
when the dynamics two strains (or two pathogens) are coupled through cross immunity, we would expect the entire system to be characterized by a single resilience value (rather than having two separate resilience for each strain)}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{as well even when we have incomplete observation of the infection dynamics}\DIFaddend .
Simulations from a simple two-strain \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{competition }\DIFaddend system illustrate that separate analyses of individual strain dynamics (e.g., RSV A vs B) and a joint analysis of total infections (e.g., total RSV infections) yield identical resilience estimates \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, confirming our expectation }\DIFdelend (Supplementary Figure S2, 3).
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This is expected because eigenvalues determine the dynamics of the entire system around the equilibrium, meaning that both strains should exhibit identical rates of return following a perturbation.
}\DIFaddend Analogous to a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{single }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{single-strain }\DIFaddend system, strong seasonal forcing in transmission can cause the \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{two-strain }\DIFaddend system to slow down through transient phenomena (Supplementary Figure S4).

These observations \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{indicate three possibilities}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{yield three insights}\DIFaddend .
First, we can directly estimate the empirical resilience of a host-pathogen system by \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{looking at how fast }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{measuring the rate at which }\DIFaddend the system approaches \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a pre-pandemic }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{an }\DIFaddend attractor, provided that we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{can measure }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{have a way to quantify }\DIFaddend the distance from \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{attractor}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the attractor---as we discuss later, the attractor of a system can be reconstructed from data from mathematical theory without making assumptions about the underlying model}\DIFaddend .
The empirical approach to estimating pathogen resilience is particularly convenient because it does not require us to know the true underlying model\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{.
As we show in Supplementary Figure S5, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{;
}\DIFaddend estimating the intrinsic resilience from fitting \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{standard compartmental }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{misspecified }\DIFaddend models can lead to biased estimates \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, especially under model misspecification}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(Supplementary Figure S5)}\DIFaddend .
Second, resilience estimates allow us to make phenomenological predictions about the dynamics of a host-pathogen system following a perturbation\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{:
assuming that }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{.
Assuming that an attractor has not changed and }\DIFaddend the distance from the attractor will decrease exponentially over time, we can \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{obtain a ballpark estimate for }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{estimate }\DIFaddend when the system \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{will }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{should }\DIFaddend reach an attractor.
Finally, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{deviation from an exponential decrease in the distance from attractor can }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a change in the (exponential) rate of approach }\DIFaddend provide information about whether the system has reached an alternative attractor, or a ghost attractor, that is different from the original, pre-pandemic attractor.
These alternative attractors may reflect \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{continued perturbations from }\DIFdelend permanent changes in transmission patterns as well as changes in immune landscapes.
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{There will be periods of time when it is difficult to tell whether pathogen dynamics are still diverging from the original attractor due to a long-term perturbation, or have entered the basin of attraction of a new attractor. 
Now that several years have passed since major interventions have been lifted, many respiratory pathogens may have had sufficient time to begin returning to their post-intervention attractors---empirical comparisons between current cases and pre-pandemic cases are consistent with this hypothesis (Figure 1).
With recent data, we can start to evaluate whether we see early signs of convergence to the former attractor or a new one.
}\DIFaddend 

\section*{Inferring pathogen resilience from real data}

Based on these \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{observations}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{patterns}\DIFaddend , we now \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{set out to infer pathogen resilience from real data.
Here, we briefly }\DIFdelend lay out our approach to estimating pathogen resilience from real data (Figure 3).
We \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{then test }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{first tested }\DIFaddend this approach against simulations and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{apply }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{applied }\DIFaddend it to real data.
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Specifically, we analyzed case time series of respiratory pathogens from four countries: Canada, Hong Kong, Korea, and the US.
}\DIFaddend 

So far, we \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{have }\DIFaddend focused on simple examples that assume a constant transmission reduction \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{during the pandemic}\DIFaddend .
However, in practice, the impact of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{NPIs }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{pandemic perturbations }\DIFaddend on pathogen transmission \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{was }\DIFaddend likely more complex (Figure 3A), reflecting introduction and relaxation of various intervention strategies.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{These complexities can }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{In some cases, strong perturbations likely caused local fadeouts, requiring immigration/importation from another location for epidemic rebound.
Such complexities could }\DIFaddend lead to longer delays between the introduction of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{NPIs and pathogen re-emergence }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{pandemic perturbations and pathogen rebound }\DIFaddend as well as temporal variation in outbreak sizes (Figure 3B)\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{:
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{;
}\DIFaddend in this example, continued transmission reduction from \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{NPIs }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{interventions }\DIFaddend limits the size of the first outbreak in 2021 following the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{emergence}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{rebound}\DIFaddend , allowing for a larger outbreak in 2022 when \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{NPIs }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{interventions }\DIFaddend are further relaxed.

Previously, we relied on the dynamics of susceptible and infected hosts to compute the distance from \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the }\DIFaddend attractor (Figure 2), but information on susceptible hosts \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{are often not }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is rarely }\DIFaddend available in practice.
In addition, uncertainties in case counts due to observation error\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{as well as the possibility of complex, multiannual attractor adds challenges to measuring }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, strain evolution, and multiannual cycles in the observed epidemic dynamics (e.g., adenovirus circulation patterns in Hong Kong and Korea) add challenges to defining pre-pandemic attractors, which limits our ability to measure }\DIFaddend the distance from \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the }\DIFaddend attractor.
To address these challenges, we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{first }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{can }\DIFaddend reconstruct an empirical attractor by utilizing Takens' theorem \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{takens2006detecting}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend , which states that an attractor of a nonlinear multidimensional system can be mapped onto a delayed embedding \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{takens2006detecting}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
.
Here, we use delayed copies of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(Materials and Methods).
For example, we can use delayed }\DIFaddend logged values of pre-pandemic cases $C(t)$ (Figure 3C) to reconstruct the attractor:
\begin{equation}
\langle\log(C(t)+1), \log(C(t-\tau)+1), \dots, \log(C(t-(M-1)\tau)+1)\rangle,
\end{equation}
where the delay $\tau$ and embedding dimension $M$ are determined based on autocorrelations and false nearest neighbors, respectively \citep{kennel1992determining,tan2023selecting}.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This allows us to define the pre-pandemic attractor as a points on an $M$ dimensional space.
We can }\DIFaddend then apply the same delay and embedding dimensions to the entire time series to determine the position \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{on a }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in }\DIFaddend multi-dimensional state space (Figure 3D), which allows us to measure the nearest neighbor distance between the current state of the system and the empirical \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{pre-pandemic }\DIFaddend attractor (Figure 3E).
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{In principle}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Specifically, the nearest neighbor distance is calculated by computing the distance between the current position on the $M$ dimensional space and all points in the empirical attractor set and taking the minimum value.
In theory}\DIFaddend , we can \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{now }\DIFaddend quantify how fast this distance decreases by fitting a linear regression on a log scale, where the slope of the linear regression \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{corresponds to pathogen resilience .
As we show in Supplementary Figure S6, overall temporal variations in the distance from attractor, especially the observed rate of decrease, appear robust }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{empirically measures pathogen resilience with a steeper slope corresponding to a higher resilience estimate (Figure 3E).
However, resulting estimates of pathogen resilience can be sensitive }\DIFaddend to choices about embedding delays and dimensions\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{; 
we note that }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{.
For example, }\DIFaddend using longer delays and higher dimensions \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{tend }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{tends }\DIFaddend to smooth out temporal variations in the distance from \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{attractor}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the attractor (Supplementary Figure S6)}\DIFaddend .

\end{figure}

Complex changes in the distance from \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the }\DIFaddend attractor suggest that estimating pathogen resilience from linear regression will \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{likely be }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{be particularly }\DIFaddend sensitive to our choice of fitting windows for the regression \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{.
In Supplementary Materials, we explore }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(Figure 3E).
Therefore, before we tried estimating resilience from real data, we explored }\DIFaddend an automated window selection \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{criteria }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{criterion }\DIFaddend for linear regression and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{test }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{tested }\DIFaddend it against randomized, stochastic simulations across a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{wide }\DIFdelend range of realistic \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{NPI shapes.
We find that resilience estimates based on the automated window selection criteria are moderately correlated (0.48) with the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{pandemic perturbation shapes.
In doing so, we also explored optimal choices for embedding dimensions and evaluated our choices of fitting window parameters and embedding dimensions by quantifying correlation coefficients between the estimated resilience and the }\DIFaddend intrinsic resilience of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the post-NPI attractor (}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a seasonally unforced system (Materials and Methods).
Overall, we found large variation in estimation performances with correlation coefficient ranging from 0.21 to 0.61 (}\DIFaddend Supplementary Figure S7).
In \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contrast, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{almost all cases, the automated window selection approach outperformed }\DIFaddend a naive approach\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{that uses the entire time series, starting from }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, which performs regression between }\DIFaddend the peak distance \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, only gives a correlation of 0.09 and consistently underestimates the intrinsic resilience }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and current distance }\DIFaddend (Supplementary Figure S7).

%DIF <  A closer observation of the resulting time series of the distance from attractor provides three important insights (Figure 3E).
%DIF <  First, the relaxation of NPIs in realistic settings can cause a false return of the system, as indicated by a rapid decrease in the distance in early 2022 followed by a rapid increase in distance.

\DIFdel{Now, we apply }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Based on the best performing window selection criteria and embedding dimension, we applied }\DIFaddend this approach to pathogen surveillance data presented in Figure \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{1.
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{1 (Materials and Methods).
}\DIFaddend For each time series, we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{apply }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{applied }\DIFaddend Takens' theorem independently to reconstruct the empirical attractor and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{obtain }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{obtained }\DIFaddend the corresponding time series of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{distance }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{distances }\DIFaddend from attractors (Supplementary Figure S8\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{for the distance time series and linear regression fits}\DIFdelend ).

We \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{find }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{found that }\DIFaddend an increase in $\mathcal R_0$ and a decrease in \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the }\DIFaddend duration of immunity correspond to an increase in pathogen resilience (Figure 5A).
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{These variations can be understood in terms of the susceptible host dynamics, where }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Similarly, an increase in $\mathcal R_0$ and a decrease in the duration of immunity corresponds to a }\DIFaddend faster per-capita \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{susceptible replenishment rate causes the system to be more resilient (Figure 5B).

For a simple SIR model that assumes a life-long immunity, we can show analytically that pathogen resilience is proportional to the per-capita rate of susceptible replenishment (Materials and Methods).
Overall, these observations suggest that a faster per-capita susceptible replenishment rate causes the system to be more resilient}\DIFaddend .

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Finally, we can now rank different pathogens based on }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{By taking }\DIFaddend the average values of empirical resilience \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, which allows us to determine }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{values for each pathogen, we were able to map each pathogen onto }\DIFaddend a set of parameters \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{of the SIRS model }\DIFaddend that are consistent with \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the estimated resilience }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{corresponding resilience estimates }\DIFaddend (Figure 5A).
Across all pathogens we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{consider, except for bocavirus and norovirus, we estimate }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{considered, we estimated }\DIFaddend that the average duration of immunity is likely to be short (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$<6$ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$<4$ }\DIFaddend years) across a plausible range of $\mathcal R_0$ \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{.

\DIFaddbegin \section*{\DIFadd{Pathogen resilience determines sensitivity to stochastic perturbations}}

\DIFadd{Even in the absence of major pandemic perturbations, host-pathogen systems are expected to experience continued perturbations of varying degrees from changes in epidemiological conditions, such as human behavior, climate, and viral evolution.
These perturbations can also arise from demographic stochasticity, which is inherent to any ecological systems.
Here, we used a seasonally unforced SIRS model with constant birth and death rates to explore how resilience of a host-pathogen system determines the sensitivity to perturbations caused by demographic stochasticity (Materials and Methods).

\DIFadd{We found that resilience of a host-pathogen system determines the amount of deviation from the deterministic trajectory caused by demographic stochasticity, with less resilient systems experiencing larger deviations (Figure 6).
Notably, less resilient systems also exhibited slower epidemic cycles (Figure 6A--C). 
The periodicity of this epidemic cycle matched those predicted by the intrinsic periodicity of the system (Supplementary Figure S13) where the intrinsic resilience of the system is inversely proportional to its intrinsic periodicity (Supplementary Figure S14).
However, we note that the interplay between seasonal transmission and intrinsic periodicity can also lead to complex cycles, as illustrated by a recent analysis of }\textit{\DIFadd{Mycoplasma pneumoniae}} \DIFadd{dynamics \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{nielsen2025complex}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
.
}

\DIFadd{We also note that the intrinsic resilience is not the sole determinant for how sensitive the system is to stochastic perturbations.
For example, the population size and average duration of infection also affect the amount of deviation from the deterministic trajectory caused by demographic stochasticity, even though these quantities have little to no impact on the intrinsic resilience (Supplementary Figure S15).
These conclusions were robust for the seasonally forced SIRS model (Supplementary Figure S16).

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The }\DIFdelend COVID-19 \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{interventions have }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{pandemic interventions }\DIFaddend caused major disruptions to circulation patterns of both respiratory and non-respiratory pathogens, adding challenges to predicting their future dynamics \citep{baker2020impact,gomez2021uncertain,koltai2022determinants,park2024predicting}.

\DIFadd{We analyzed case time series of common respiratory infections and norovirus infections from Canada, Hong Kong, Korea, and the US to estimate their resilience}\DIFaddend .
Overall, we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{estimate that the resilience for most common respiratory pathogens ranges between }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{estimated the resilience of these pathogens to range from }\DIFaddend $0.4/\mathrm{year}$ \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{to }\DIFaddend $1.8/\mathrm{year}$, which is 3--14 times more resilient than prevaccination measles\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{.
Consistent with other epidemiological evidence \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{bosis2008role,o2009symptomatic,pitzer2015environmental,edridge2020seasonal}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Our framework allows us to make }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Based on our resilience estimates, we made }\DIFaddend phenomenological predictions about when each pathogen will return to their endemic cycles.

\DIFdel{Our analyses suggest a possibility that several pathogens may have converged to different endemic cycles compared to their pre-pandemic epidemic patterns.
Key examples include human metapnuemovirus, RSV, and bocavirus in Korea as well as RSV in Hong Kong.
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{For the most part, we accurately predicted which pathogens should have already returned before the end of 2024.
However, there were two main exceptions (i.e., norovirus in Hong Kong and rhinovirus/enterovirus in the US), suggesting that these pathogens may be converging to new endemic cycles or experiencing long-term transient behavior.
}\DIFaddend These changes may reflect changes in surveillance or actual shift in the dynamics, caused by permanent changes in behavior or population-level immunity.
While it \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{seems }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{may seem }\DIFaddend unlikely that permanent changes in behavior would only affect a few pathogens and not others, we cannot rule out this possibility given \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{heterogeneity in the age of infection across different respiratory pathogens }%DIFDELCMD < \swp{CITE}%%%
\DIFdel{.
A shift in population-level immunity is plausible, as the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and extinction of influenza B/Yamagata likely caused major changes in immune landscapes;
interactions among co-circulating pathogens, such as cross immunity between RSV and HMPV \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{bhattacharyya2015cross}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
, may have also contributed to changes in population-level immunity.
However, we currently do not know how immunity, or lack thereof, from these pathogens would affect infection from other pathogens.
Future studies should use detailed mechanistic models, coupled with behavioral and immunological data , to test these hypotheses and better understand post-pandemic dynamics of endemic pathogens .

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{For almost half of the pathogens we considered, we predicted that their return to original epidemic patterns is imminent.
We will need a few more years of data to test whether these pathogens will eventually return to their original dynamics or eventually converge to a different attractor.

Overall, these observations echo earlier studies that highlighted the long-lasting impact of pandemic perturbations \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

\DIFaddend We \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{show }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{showed }\DIFaddend that susceptible host dynamics shape pathogen resilience, where faster replenishment of the susceptible population causes the pathogen to be more resilient.
For simplicity, we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{focus }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{focused }\DIFaddend on waning immunity and birth as \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a main driver }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the main drivers }\DIFaddend of the susceptible host dynamics but other mechanisms can also contribute to the replenishment of the susceptible population.
In particular, pathogen evolution, especially the emergence of antigenically novel strains, can cause effective waning of immunity in the population;
therefore, we hypothesize that \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{faster rates }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the rate }\DIFaddend of antigenic evolution \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{can also cause a pathogen to be more resilient}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is likely a key feature of pathogen resilience}\DIFaddend .
Future studies should explore the relationship between the rate of evolution and resilience for antigenically evolving pathogens.
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This result also highlights the importance of detailed measurements of changes in the susceptible population through serological assays for understanding pathogen dynamics \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{nguyen2022enterovirus}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
.
}\DIFaddend 

Quantifying pathogen resilience also offers novel approaches to validating population-level epidemiological models.
So far, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the majority of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{most }\DIFaddend model validation in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{epidemiology }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{infectious disease ecology }\DIFaddend is based on the ability of a model to reproduce the observed epidemic dynamics and to predict future dynamics \citep{grenfell2002dynamics,bhattacharyya2015cross,pitzer2015environmental,dean2018human,pons2018serotype}.
However, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{there can be plethora of models that meet }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{many models can perform similarly under }\DIFaddend these criteria.
For example, two major RSV models have been proposed \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{so far }\DIFdelend to explain biennial epidemic patterns: (1) a stage- and age-structured model that allows \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{for }\DIFdelend disease severity to vary with number of past infections and age of infection \citep{pitzer2015environmental} and (2) a pathogen-interaction model that accounts for cross immunity between RSV and human \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{metapnuemovirus }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{metapneumovirus }\DIFaddend \citep{bhattacharyya2015cross}.
Since both models can accurately reproduce the observed epidemic patterns, standard criteria for model validation do not allow us to distinguish between these two models from population-level data alone.
Instead, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{we can }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{it would be possible to }\DIFaddend measure the empirical resilience of each model by simulating various perturbations and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{compare them }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{comparing the simulations }\DIFaddend to estimates of empirical resilience from data, using \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{COVID-19 interventions as an opportunity.
Future studies should further investigate using pathogen resilience for validating epidemic models.
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{pandemic perturbations as a reference.
}\DIFaddend 

There are several limitations to our work.
First\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{of all}\DIFdelend , we did not extensively explore other approaches to reconstructing the attractor.
Recent studies showed that more sophisticated approaches, such as using non-uniform embedding, can provide more robust reconstruction for noisy data \citep{tan2023selecting}.
In the context of causal inference, choices about embedding can have major impact on the resulting inference \citep{cobey2016limits}.
Our resilience estimates are likely overly confident given a lack of uncertainties in attractor reconstruction as well as the simplicity of our statistical framework.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Short pre-pandemic time series also contributes to the crudeness of our estimates.
}\DIFdelend Nonetheless, as illustrated in our sensitivity analyses\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(Supplementary Figure S6, S10--S12), }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend inferences about pathogen resilience \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in our SIRS model }\DIFaddend appear to be robust to decisions about embedding lags and dimensions---this is because tracking the rate at which the system approaches the attractor is likely a much simpler problem than making inferences about causal directionality.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Our }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Short pre-pandemic time series also limit our ability to accurately reconstruct the attractor and contribute to the crudeness of our resilience estimates;
although this is less likely a problem for respiratory pathogens that are strongly annual, our attractor reconstruction may be inaccurate for those exhibiting multi-annual cycles, such as adenovirus in Hong Kong and Korea.
Our framework also do not allow us to distinguish whether a system has settled to a new attractor or is experiencing long-term transient behavior.
Uncertainties in pathogen dynamics due to changes in testing patterns further contribute to the crudeness of our resilience estimates.
}

\DIFadd{While attractor reconstruction methods allow us to make model-free inferences of pathogen resilience, it does not allow us to tease apart how different mechanisms contribute to the resilience a host-pathogen system.
Using the simple SIRS model, we illustrated that susceptible host dynamics are key determinants for pathogen resilience, but we also found that there isn't a one-to-one correspondence between per capita replenishment rate of the susceptible population and pathogen resilience estimates.
Future studies should explore using mechanistic models to explain heterogeneity in resilience estimates across different pathogens.
}

\DIFadd{Finally, our simulation-based analyses primarily focused on single-strain systems but real-world pathogens can interact with other pathogens, which can result in complex dynamics \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{rohani2003ecological,nickbakhsh2019virus}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
.
To address this limitation, we considered a simple two-strain competition system with cross immunity and showed that the resilience of a coupled system can be measured by studying the dynamics of either strains. 
However, this conclusion likely depend on the strength of strain interaction as well as the underlying details of the model.
For example, ecological interference between two unrelated pathogens \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{rohani2003ecological} }\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
will likely generate weaker coupling than cross immunity between related pathogens;
in the former case, we do not necessarily expect two unrelated pathogens to have same resilience despite their ecological interference.
Some pathogen strains can also exhibit positive interactions where infection by one strain can lead to an increased transmission of another competing strain.
For example, previous studies showed that an increased dengue transmission through antibody-dependent enhancement can permit coexistence and persistence of competing strains \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{ferguson1999effect}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
;
based on these observations, we tentatively hypothesize that positive interactions such as antibody-dependent enhancement may increase the resilience of a system.
Future studies should explore how different mechanisms of pathogen interactions contribute to the resilience of each competing pathogen as well as the entire system.
Despite these limitations, our study illustrates that quantifying pathogen resilience can provide novel insights into pathogen dynamics.
Furthermore, our }\DIFaddend qualitative prediction that common respiratory pathogens are more resilient than prevaccination measles is also likely to be robust\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{to these predictions}\DIFdelend , given how \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{rapid }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{rapidly }\DIFaddend many respiratory pathogens returned to their original cycles following \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{COVID-19 interventions.

Predicting the impact of anthropogenic changes on infectious disease dynamics is a fundamental aim of infectious disease research in a rapidly changing world.
Our study illustrates that \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{quantifying pathogen resilience can help us understand how infectious disease pathogensrespond to major perturbationscaused by public health interventions}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{how a host-pathogen system responds to both small and large perturbations is largely predictable through the lens of ecological resilience.

}

\DIFaddend \subsection*{Estimating pathogen resilience}

In order to measure pathogen resilience from surveillance data, we first \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{reconstruct }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{reconstructed }\DIFaddend the empirical pre-pandemic attractor of the system using Takens' embedding theorem \citep{takens2006detecting}.
Specifically, for a given pathogen, we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{take }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{took }\DIFaddend the pre-pandemic (before 2020) case time series $C(t)$ and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{reconstruct }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{reconstructed }\DIFaddend the attractor using delayed embedding with a uniform delay of $\tau$ and dimension $M$:
\begin{equation}
X_{\tau,m}(t) = \langle\log(C(t)+1), \log(C(t-\tau)+1), \dots, \log(C(t-(M-1)\tau)+1)\rangle.
\end{equation}
Here, the delay $\tau$ \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is determined by looking at }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{was determined by calculating }\DIFaddend the autocorrelation of the logged pre-pandemic time series and asking when the autocorrelation crosses 0 for the first time \citep{tan2023selecting};
a typical delay for \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{for }\DIFdelend an annual outbreak is around 13 weeks.

Then, for a given delay $\tau$, we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{determine }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{determined }\DIFaddend the embedding dimension $M$ using the false nearest neighbors approach \citep{kennel1992determining,tan2023selecting}.
To do so, we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{start }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{started }\DIFaddend with an embedding dimension $e$ and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{construct }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{constructed }\DIFaddend a set of points $A_{\tau,e}= \{X_{\tau,e}(t) | t < 2020\}$.
Then, for each point $X_{\tau,e}(t)$, we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{determine }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{determined }\DIFaddend the nearest neighbor from the set $A_{\tau,e}$, which we denote $X_{\tau,e}(\tsub{t}{nn})$ for $t \neq \tsub{t}{nn}$.
Then, if the distance between these two points \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{on }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in the }\DIFaddend $e+1$ dimension, $D_{\tau,e+1}(t) = ||X_{\tau,e+1}(\tsub{t}{nn})-X_{\tau,e+1}(t)||_2$, is larger than their distance \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{on }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in the }\DIFaddend $e$ dimension, $D_{\tau,e}(t) = ||X_{\tau,e}(\tsub{t}{nn})-X_{\tau,e}(t)||_2$, these two points are deemed to be false nearest neighbors;
specifically, we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{use }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{used }\DIFaddend a threshold $R$ for the ratio between two distances $D_{\tau,e+1}(t)/D_{\tau,e}(t)$ to determine false nearest neighbors.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{In the main text, we determine embedding dimension based as the first dimension without }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The first embedding dimension $e$ that does not have }\DIFaddend any false nearest neighbors \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{for $R=10$.
In Supplementary Materials, we impose $R=5$ to select for higher dimensions}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{corresponds to the embedding dimension $M$ for a given pathogen-country pair.
For the main analysis, we used $R=10$, which was chosen from a sensitivity analysis against simulated data (Supplementary Text)}\DIFaddend .
Once we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{determine }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{determined }\DIFaddend the embedding lag $\tau$ and dimension $M$, we apply the embedding to the entire time series and calculate the nearest neighbor distance against the attractor $A_{\tau,M}$ to obtain a time series of distance from \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the }\DIFaddend attractor $D_{\tau,M}(t)$.

From a time series of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{distance from }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{distances from the }\DIFaddend attractor, we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{estimate }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{estimated }\DIFaddend pathogen resilience by fitting a linear regression to an appropriate window.
To automatically select \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the fitting window, we begin }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{fitting windows, we began }\DIFaddend by smoothing the distance time series using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) to obtain $\hat{D}_{\tau,M}(t)$, where the smoothing is performed on a log scale and exponentiated afterwards.
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This smoothing allowed us to find appropriate threshold values for selecting fitting windows that are insensitive to errors in our estimates of distance from the attractor.
}\DIFaddend Then, we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{determine }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{determined }\DIFaddend threshold values ($\tsub{T}{start}$ and $\tsub{T}{end}$) for the smoothed distances and choose the fitting window based on when $\hat{D}_{\tau,M}(t)$ crosses these threshold values for the first time.
These thresholds \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{are }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{were }\DIFaddend determined by first calculating \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the }\DIFaddend maximum distance,
\begin{equation}
\max \hat{D} = \max \hat{D}_{\tau,M}(t),
\end{equation}
and \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the }\DIFaddend mean pre-pandemic distance,
\begin{equation}
\tsub{\hat{D}}{mean} = \frac{1}{N_{t<2020}} \sum_{t < 2020} \hat{D}_{\tau,M}(t),
\end{equation}
as a reference, and then dividing their ratios into \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{10 equal bins:
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$K$ equal bins,
}\DIFaddend \begin{align}
\tsub{T}{start} &= \tsub{\hat{D}}{mean} \times \left(\frac{\max \hat{D}}{\tsub{\hat{D}}{mean}} \right)\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{^{9/10}}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{^{(K-a)/K},}\DIFaddend \\
\tsub{T}{end} &= \tsub{\hat{D}}{mean} \times \left(\frac{\max \hat{D}}{\tsub{\hat{D}}{mean}} \right)\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{^{1/10}
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{^{a/K},
}\DIFaddend \end{align}
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{where $a$ represents the truncation threshold.
}\DIFaddend This allows us to discard the initial period during which the distance increases (from the introduction of intervention measures) and the final period during which the distance plateaus (as the system reaches an attractor).
The fitting window is determined based on when the smoothed distance $\hat{D}_{\tau,M}(t)$ crosses these threshold values for the first time; then, we fit a linear regression to logged (unsmoothed) distances $\log D_{\tau,M}(t)$ using that window.
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Alongside the threshold $R$ for the false nearest neighbors approach, we tested optimal choices for $K$ and $a$ values using simulations (Supplementary Text).
We used $K=19$ and $a=2$ throughout the paper based on the simulation results.
}\DIFaddend 

\subsection*{Mathematical modeling}

Throughout the paper, we use a series of mathematical models to illustrate the concept of pathogen resilience and to understand the determinants of pathogen resilience.
In general, the intrinsic resilience \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{for }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{of }\DIFaddend a given system is given by the largest real part of the eigenvalues of the linearized system at endemic equilibrium.
Here, we focus on the SIRS model \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{with demography (birth and death) and }\DIFaddend present the details of other models in Supplementary \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Materials}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Text}\DIFaddend .
The SIRS (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible) model is the simplest model that allows for waning of immunity, where recovered (immune) individuals are assumed to become fully susceptible after an average of $1/\delta$ time period.
The dynamics of the SIRS model is described by the following set of differential equations:
\begin{align}
\frac{\dd S}{\dd t} &= \mu - \beta(t) SI - \mu S + \delta R \\
\frac{\dd I}{\dd t} &= \beta(t) SI - (\gamma + \mu) I \\
\frac{\dd R}{\dd t} &= \gamma I - (\delta + \mu) R
\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \\
%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend \end{align}
where $\mu$ represents the birth \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{/death rate}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and death rates}\DIFaddend , $\beta(t)$ represents the time-varying transmission rate, and $\gamma$ represents the recovery rate.
The basic reproduction number \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$\mathcal R_0 = \beta(t)/(\gamma + \mu)$ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$\mathcal R_0(t) = \beta(t)/(\gamma + \mu)$ }\DIFaddend is defined as the average number of secondary infections \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{caused by }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{that }\DIFaddend a single infected individual \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{would cause }\DIFaddend in a fully susceptible population \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{at time $t$ }\DIFaddend and measures the intrinsic transmissibility of a pathogen.

When we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{first introduce }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{introduced }\DIFaddend the idea of pathogen resilience (Figure 2), we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{impose }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{imposed }\DIFaddend sinusoidal changes to the transmission rate to account for seasonal transmission\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{:
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{,
}\DIFaddend \begin{equation}
\beta(t) = b_1 (1 + \theta \cos(2 \pi (t-\phi))) \alpha(t),
\end{equation}
where $b_1$ represents the baseline transmission rate, $\theta$ represents the seasonal amplitude, and $\phi$ represents the seasonal offset term.
Here, we also \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{introduce }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{introduced }\DIFaddend an extra multiplicative term $\alpha(t)$ to account for the impact of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{COVID-19 interventions}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{pandemic perturbations}\DIFaddend , where $\alpha(t) < 1$ indicates transmission reduction.
Figure 2A and 2B \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{are }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{were }\DIFaddend generated assuming $b_1 = 3 \times (365/7+1/50)/\mathrm{years}$, $\theta=0.2$, $\phi=0$, $\mu=1/50/\mathrm{years}$, $\gamma=365/7/\mathrm{years}$, and $\delta=1/2/\mathrm{years}$\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{,
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{.
Specifically, $b_1 = 3 \times (365/7+1/50)/\mathrm{years}$ implies $\mathcal R_0 = 3$, where $(365/7+1/50)/\mathrm{years}$ represent the rate of recovery.
}\DIFaddend In Figure 2A, we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{impose }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{imposed }\DIFaddend a 50\% transmission reduction for 6 months from 2020:
\begin{equation}
\alpha(t) = \begin{cases}
0.5 & 2020 \leq t< 2020.5\\
1 & \textrm{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
In Figure 2B, we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{impose }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{imposed }\DIFaddend a 50\% transmission reduction for 6 months from 2020 and a permanent 10\% reduction onward:
\begin{equation}
\alpha(t) = \begin{cases}
1 & t < 2020\\
0.5 & 2020 \leq t < 2020.5\\
0.9 & 2020.5 \leq t
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
In both scenarios, we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{simulate }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{simulated }\DIFaddend the SIRS model from the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{following }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{same }\DIFaddend initial conditions ($S(0) = 1/\mathcal R_0$, $I(0) = 1\times 10^{-6}$, and $R(0) = 1 - S(0) - I(0)$) from 1900 until 2030.
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Throughout the paper, all deterministic models were solved using the }\texttt{\DIFadd{lsoda}} \DIFadd{solver from the }\texttt{\DIFadd{deSolve}} \DIFadd{package \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{soetaert2010solving} }\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
in }\texttt{\DIFadd{R}} \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{citeR}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
.
}\DIFaddend 

To measure the empirical resilience of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{SIR }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{SIRS }\DIFaddend model (Figure 2C and 2F), we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{compute }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{computed }\DIFaddend the normalized distance between post-intervention susceptible and logged infected proportions and their corresponding \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{pre-intervention }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{unperturbed }\DIFaddend values at the same time\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{of year:
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{:
}\DIFaddend \begin{equation}
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\sqrt{\left(\frac{S(t) - \tsub{S}{pre}(t)}{\sigma_S}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\log I(t) - \log \tsub{I}{pre}(t)}{\sigma_{\log I}}\right)^2}}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\sqrt{\left(\frac{S(t) - \tsub{S}{unperturbed}(t)}{\sigma_S}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\log I(t) - \log \tsub{I}{unperturbed}(t)}{\sigma_{\log I}}\right)^2}}\DIFaddend ,
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_S$ and $\sigma_{\log I}$ represent the standard deviation in the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{pre-intervention }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{unperturbed }\DIFaddend susceptible and logged infected proportions.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We normalize }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The unperturbed values were obtained by simulating the same SIRS model without pandemic perturbations ($\alpha = 1$).
We normalized }\DIFaddend the differences in susceptible and logged infected proportions to allow both quantities to equally contribute to the changes in distance from \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{attractor.
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the attractor.
We used logged prevalence, instead of absolute prevalence, in order to capture epidemic dynamics in deep troughs during the intervention period.
}\DIFaddend In Supplementary Materials, we also \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{compare the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{compared }\DIFaddend how the degree of seasonal transmission affects empirical resilience by varying $\theta$ from 0 to 0.4; when we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{assume }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{assumed }\DIFaddend no seasonality ($\theta = 0$), we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{do }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{did }\DIFaddend not normalize the distance because the standard deviation of pre-intervention dynamics are zero. 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Finally, we use }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{We used }\DIFaddend the SIRS model to understand how underlying epidemiological parameters affect pathogen resilience and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{link this }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{determine the }\DIFaddend relationship to underlying susceptible host dynamics.
For the simple SIRS model without seasonal transmission ($\theta = 0$), the intrinsic resilience \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{corresponds to:
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{equals
}\DIFaddend \begin{equation}
-\frac{\mathrm{Re}(\lambda)}{2} = \frac{\delta + \beta I^{\ast} + \mu}{2}.
\end{equation}
Here, $I^{\ast}$ represents the prevalence \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{values }\DIFdelend at endemic equilibrium:
\begin{equation}
I^{\ast} = \frac{(\delta + \mu)(\beta - (\gamma + \mu))}{\beta(\delta + \gamma + \mu)}.
\end{equation}
The susceptible replenishment rate is given by
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{:
}\DIFdelend \begin{equation}
\tsub{S}{replenish} = \frac{\mu + \delta R}{S^\ast},
\end{equation}
where $S^\ast = 1/\mathcal R_0$ represents the equilibrium proportion of susceptible individuals.
We \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{vary }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{varied }\DIFaddend the basic reproduction number $\mathcal R_0$ between 1.1 to 6 and the average duration of immunity $1/\delta$ between 2 to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{80 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{4 }\DIFaddend years, and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{compute }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{computed }\DIFaddend these two quantities.
In doing so, we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{fix }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{fixed }\DIFaddend all other parameters: $\mu=1/80/\mathrm{years}$ and $\gamma=365/7/\mathrm{years}$.
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{When infection provides a life-long immunity ($\delta = 0$), the intrinsic resilience is inversely proportional to the susceptible replenishment rate:
}\begin{equation}
\DIFadd{-\frac{\mathrm{Re}(\lambda)}{2} = \frac{\mu}{2 S^\ast} = \frac{\tsub{S}{replenish}}{2}.
}\end{equation}
\DIFaddend 

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Finally, we used a seasonally unforced stochastic SIRS model without demography to understand how pathogen resilience affects sensitivity of the system to demographic stochasticity (see Supplementary Text for the details of the stochastic SIRS model).
By varying the basic reproduction number $\mathcal R_0$ between 2 to 20 and the average duration of immunity $1/\delta$ between 1 to 40 years, we ran the SIRS model for 100 years and computed the epidemic amplitude, which we defined as  $(\max I - \min I)/(2 \bar{I})$.
Each simulation began from the equilibrium, and we truncated the initial 25 years before computing the epidemic amplitude.
In doing so, we assumed $\gamma=365/7/\mathrm{years}$ and fixed the population size to 1 billion to prevent any fadeouts.
We also considered a seasonally forced stochastic SIRS model without demography, assuming an amplitude of seasonal forcing of $0.04$;
in this case, we computed the relative epidemic amplitude by comparing the deterministic and stochastic trajectories (Supplementary Materials).

\subsection*{Resilience of a stage-structured system.}

In Figure 2G--I, we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{use }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{used }\DIFaddend a more realistic, stage-structured model to illustrate how transient phenomena can cause the system to slow down.
Specifically, we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{use }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{used }\DIFaddend the stage-structured RSV model proposed by \citep{pitzer2015environmental}, which assumes that subsequent reinfections cause an individual to become less susceptible and transmissible than previous infections.
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{In contrast to a standard SIRS model, this model does not include a recovered compartment, which allow for temporary protection against new infections, and assumes that recoverd individuals are immediately susceptible to new infections.
}\DIFaddend The model dynamics can be described as follows:
\begin{align}
\frac{\dd M}{\dd t} &= \mu - (\omega + \mu) M\\
\frac{\dd S_0}{\dd t} &= \omega M - (\lambda(t) + \mu) S_0\\
\frac{\dd I_1}{\dd t} &= \lambda(t) S_0 - (\gamma_1 + \mu) I_1\\
\frac{\dd S_1}{\dd t} &= \gamma_1 I_1 - (\sigma_1 \lambda(t) + \mu) S_1\\
\frac{\dd I_2}{\dd t} &= \sigma_1 \lambda(t) S_1 - (\gamma_2 + \mu) I_2\\
\frac{\dd S_2}{\dd t} &= \gamma_2 I_2 - (\sigma_2 \lambda(t) + \mu) S_2\\
\frac{\dd I_3}{\dd t} &= \sigma_2 \lambda(t) S_2 - (\gamma_3 + \mu) I_3\\
\frac{\dd S_3}{\dd t} &= \gamma_3 I_3 - (\sigma_3 \lambda(t) + \mu) S_3 + \gamma_4 I_4\\
\frac{\dd I_4}{\dd t} &= \sigma_3 \lambda(t) S_3 - (\gamma_4 + \mu) I_4
\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \\
%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend \end{align}
where $M$ represents the proportion of individuals who are maternally immune;
$S_i$ represents the proportion of individuals who are susceptible after $i$ prior infections;
$I_i$ represents the proportion of individuals who are currently (re)-infected with their $i$-th infection;
$\mu$ represents the birth and death rates;
$1/\omega$ represents the mean duration of maternal immunity;
$1/\gamma_i$ represents the mean duration of infection;
$\lambda(t)$ represents the force of infection;
and $\sigma_i$ represents the reduction in susceptibility for \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the $i$-th }\DIFaddend reinfection.
The force of infection is modeled using a sinusoidal function:
\begin{align}
\beta(t) &= b_1 (1 + \theta \cos(2 \pi (t-\phi))) \alpha(t)\\
\lambda(t) &= \beta (I_1 + \rho_1 I_2 + \rho_2 (I_3 + I_4)), 
\end{align}
where $b_1$ represents the baseline transmission rate; $\theta$ represents the seasonal amplitude; $\phi$ represents the seasonal offset term; $\alpha(t)$ represents the intervention effect; and $\rho_i$ represents the impact of immunity on transmission reduction.
We \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{use }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{used }\DIFaddend the following parameters to simulate the impact of interventions on epidemic dynamics \citep{pitzer2015environmental}: $b_1 = 9 \times (365/10+1/80)/\mathrm{years}$, $\theta = 0.2$, $\phi = -0.1$, $\omega=365/112/\mathrm{years}$, $\gamma_1=365/10/\mathrm{years}$, $\gamma_2=365/7/\mathrm{years}$, $\gamma_3=365/5/\mathrm{years}$, $\sigma_1 = 0.76$, $\sigma_2 = 0.6$, $\sigma_3 = 0.4$, $\rho_1 = 0.75$, $\rho_2 = 0.51$, and $\mu = 1/80/\mathrm{years}$.
We \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{assume }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{assumed }\DIFaddend a 50\% transmission reduction for 6 months from 2020:
\begin{equation}
\alpha(t) = \begin{cases}
0.5 & 2020 \leq t< 2020.5\\
1 & \textrm{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
The model \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{was }\DIFaddend simulated from 1900 to 2030 using the following initial conditions: $M=0$, $S_0=1/\mathcal R_0-I_1$, $I_1=1\times 10^{-6}$, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$S1=1-1/\mathcal R_0$}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$S_1=1-1/\mathcal R_0$}\DIFaddend , $I_2=0$, $S_2=0$, $I_3=0$, $S_3=0$, and $I_4=0$.
For the phase plane analysis (Figure 2H) and distance analysis (Figure 2I), we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{rely }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{relied }\DIFaddend on the average susceptibility,
\begin{equation}
\bar{S} = S_0 + \sigma_1 S_1 + \sigma_2 S_2 + \sigma_3 S_3,
\end{equation}
and total prevalence,
\begin{equation}
\tsub{I}{total} = I_1 + I_2 + I_3 + I_4.
\end{equation}
These quantities \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{are }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{were }\DIFaddend used to compute the normalized distance from the attractor, as described in the main text.

\subsection*{Resilience of a multistrain system.}

We \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{use }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{used }\DIFaddend a simple two-strain model to show that a multistrain host-pathogen system that is coupled through cross immunity can be described by a single resilience value.
The model dynamics can be described as follows \citep{bhattacharyya2015cross}: 
\begin{align}
\frac{\dd S}{\dd t} &= \mu - \mu S - (\lambda_1 + \lambda_2) S + \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\rho}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\delta}\DIFaddend _1 R_1 + \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\rho}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\delta}\DIFaddend _2 R_2 \\

\frac{\dd J_2}{\dd t} &= \lambda_2 \epsilon_{21} R_1 - (\gamma_2 + \mu) J_2\\
\frac{\dd R}{\dd t} &= \gamma_1 J_1 + \gamma_2 J_2 - \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\rho}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\delta}\DIFaddend _1 R - \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\rho}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\delta}\DIFaddend _2 R - \mu R
\end{align}
where $S$ represents the proportion of individuals who are fully susceptible to infections by both strains;
$I_1$ represents the proportion of individuals who are infected with strain 1 without prior immunity;
$I_2$ represents the proportion of individuals who are infected with strain 2 without prior immunity;
$R_1$ represents the proportion of individuals who are fully immune against strain 1 and partially susceptible to reinfection by strain 2;
$R_2$ represents the proportion of individuals who are fully immune against strain 2 and partially susceptible to reinfection by strain 1;

$\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ represent the recovery rate;
$\epsilon_{21}$ and $\epsilon_{12}$ represent the susceptibility to reinfection with strains 2 and 1, respectively, given prior immunity from infection with strains 1 and 2, respectively. 
The force of infection is modeled as follows:
\begin{align}
\beta_1 &= b_1 (1 + \theta_1 \sin(2 \pi (t-\phi_1))) \alpha(t)\\
\beta_2 &= b_2 (1 + \theta_2 \sin(2 \pi (t-\phi_2))) \alpha(t)\\
\lambda_1 &= \beta_1 (I_1 + J_1)\\
\lambda_2 &= \beta_2 (I_2 + J_2)
\end{align}
In Supplementary Figures S2--S4, we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{assume }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{assumed }\DIFaddend the following parameters:
$b_1 = 2 \times 52/\mathrm{years}$, $b_2 = 4 \times 52/\mathrm{years}$, $\phi_1 = \phi_2 = 0$, $\epsilon_{12} = 0.9$, $\epsilon_{21} = 0.5$,

For all simulations, we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{assume }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{assumed }\DIFaddend a 50\% transmission reduction for 6 months from 2020:

The seasonal amplitude $\theta$ is varied from 0 to 0.4.
All simulations \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{are ran }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{were run }\DIFaddend from 1900 to 2030 \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{from the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{with }\DIFaddend following initial conditions:

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{For this, we consider three different }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{We considered three }\DIFaddend scenarios for measuring pathogen resilience: (1) we only have information about strain 1, (2) we only have information about strain 2, and (3) we are unable to distinguish \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the differences }\DIFdelend between strains.
In the first two scenarios (see panels A--C for strain 1 and panels D--F for strain 2), we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{consider }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{considered }\DIFaddend the dynamics of average susceptibility for each strain and total prevalence:
\begin{align}

\end{align}
In the third scenario (panels G--I), we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{consider }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{considered }\DIFaddend the dynamics of total susceptible and infected \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{population:

These quantities \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{are }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{were }\DIFaddend used to compute the normalized distance from the attractor, as described in the main text.

\subsection*{Estimating intrinsic resilience using \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a }\DIFaddend mechanistic model}

We \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{test }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{tested }\DIFaddend whether we can reliably estimate the intrinsic resilience of a system by fitting a mechanistic model.
Specifically, we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{simulate }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{simulated }\DIFaddend case time series from stochastic SIRS and two-strain models and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{fit }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{fitted }\DIFaddend a simple, deterministic SIRS model using a Bayesian framework \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{First, we describe the simulation set up.
The stochastic SIRS model can be written as follows}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{We simulated the models in discrete time with a daily time step ($\Delta t = 1$), incorporating demographic stochasticity}\DIFaddend :
\begin{align}
\beta(t) &= \mathcal R_0 \left(1 + \theta \cos\left(\frac{2 \pi t}{364}\right)\right) \alpha(t)  (1-\exp(-\gamma))\\
\textrm{FOI}(t) &= \beta(t) I(t- \Delta t)/N\\

I(t) &= I(t-\Delta t) + N_{SI}(t) - \Delta I(t)\\
R(t) &= R(t-\Delta t) + N_{IR}(t) - \Delta R(t)
\end{align}
where $\textrm{FOI}$ \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{represent }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{represents }\DIFaddend the force of infection;
$N_{ij}$ \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{represent }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{represents }\DIFaddend the number of individuals moving from compartment $i$ to $j$ on a given day;

$\mathcal R_0 = 3$, $\theta = 0.1$, $\gamma = 1/7/\mathrm{days}$, $\delta = 1/(364\times 2)/\mathrm{days}$,
$\mu =1/(364\times 50)/\mathrm{days}$, and $N = 1 \times 10^{8}$.
The model \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{was }\DIFaddend simulated from 1900 to 2030 assuming $S(0) = N/3$, $I(0) = 100$, and $R(0) = N - S(0) - I(0)$.
The observed incidence from the model \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{was }\DIFaddend then simulated as follows:

\end{align}
We \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{simulate }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{simulated }\DIFaddend the model on a daily scale with previously estimated parameters for the RSV-HMPV interaction \citep{bhattacharyya2015cross}:
$b_1=1.7/\mathrm{weeks}$, $b_1=1.95/\mathrm{weeks}$, $\theta_1 = 0.4$, $\theta_2 = 0.3$, $\phi_1=0.005 \times 7/364$, $\phi_2=4.99 \times 7/364$, $\epsilon_{12}=0.92$, $\epsilon_{21}=0.45$, $\gamma_1=1/10/\mathrm{days}$, $\gamma_2=1/10/\mathrm{days}$, $\rho_1=1/364/\mathrm{days}$, $\rho_2=1/364/\mathrm{days}$, $\mu=1/(70\times 364)/\mathrm{days}$, and $N = 1 \times 10^8$.
The model \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{was }\DIFaddend simulated from 1900 to 2030 assuming $S(0) = N - 200$, $I_1(0) = 100$, $I_2(0) = 100$, $R_1(0) = 0$, $R_2(0) = 0$, $J_1(0) = 0$, $J_2(0) = 0$, and $R(0) = 0$.
The observed incidence for each strain is then simulated as follows:
\begin{align}
C_1(t) &= \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mathrm{Beta-Binom}}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \textrm{\DIFadd{Beta-Binom}}\DIFaddend (N_{SI_1}(t) + N_{R_2J_1}, \rho, k),\\

\end{align}
where $\rho$ represents the reporting probability and $k$ represents the overdispersion parameter of beta-binomial distribution.
We \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{assume }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{assumed }\DIFaddend $\rho = 0.002$ (i.e., 0.2\% probability) and $k = 500$.
We also \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{consider }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{considered }\DIFaddend the total incidence: $\tsub{C}{total}(t) = C_1(t) + C_2(t)$.

For both models, we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{consider a more realistic challenges in intervention effects }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{considered a more realistically shaped pandemic perturbation }\DIFaddend $\alpha(t)$ to challenge our ability to estimate the intervention effects.
Thus, we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{assume }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{assumed }\DIFaddend a 40\% transmission reduction for 3 months from March 2020, followed by a 10\% transmission reduction for 6 months, 20\% transmission reduction for 3 months, and a final return to normal levels:
\begin{equation}
\alpha(t) = \begin{cases}
1 & t < 2020.25\\
0.6 & 2020.25 \leq t < 2020.5\\
0.9 & 2020.5 \leq t < 2021\\
0.8 & 2021 \leq t < 2021.25\\
1 & 2021.25 \leq t
\end{cases}.
\end{equation}
For all simulations, we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{truncate }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{truncated }\DIFaddend the time series from the beginning of 2014 to the end of 2023 and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{aggregate }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{aggregated }\DIFaddend them into weekly cases.

To infer intrinsic resilience from time series, we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{fit }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{fitted }\DIFaddend a simple discrete time, deterministic SIRS model \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in a Bayesian framework }\DIFaddend \citep{park2024predicting}:
\begin{align}
\Delta t &= 1\,\mathrm{week}\\
\textrm{FOI}(t) &= \beta(t) (I(t- \Delta t)+\omega)/N\\
\Delta S(t) &= \left[1- \exp(-(\textrm{FOI}(t) + \mu) \Delta t )\right] S(t-\Delta t)\\
N_{SI}(t) &= \frac{\textrm{FOI}(t)\Delta S(t)}{\textrm{FOI}(t) + \mu} \\
\Delta I(t) &= \left[1- \exp(-(\gamma + \mu) \Delta t )\right] I(t-\Delta t)\\
N_{IR}(t) &= \frac{\gamma \Delta I(t)}{\gamma + \mu} \\
\Delta R(t) &= \left[1- \exp(-(\nu + \mu) \Delta t )\right] R(t-\Delta t)\\
N_{RS}(t) &= \frac{\nu \Delta R(t)}{\nu + \mu} \\
S(t) &= S(t-\Delta t) + \mu S - \Delta S(t) + N_{RS}(t)  \\
I(t) &= I(t-\Delta t) - \Delta I(t) + N_{SI}(t)  \\
R(t) &= R(t-\Delta t) - \Delta R(t) + N_{IR}(t)
\end{align}
where we include an extra term $\omega$ to account for \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{external infections}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{importation}\DIFaddend .
Although actual simulations \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{do }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{did }\DIFaddend not include any \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{external infections, we }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{importation, we had }\DIFaddend found that including this term generally helped with model convergence in previous analyses \citep{park2024predicting}.
The transmission rate \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{was }\DIFaddend divided into a seasonal term $\tsub{\beta}{seas}(t)$ (repeated every year) and intervention term $\alpha(t)$, which \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{are }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{were }\DIFaddend estimated jointly:
\begin{align}
\beta(t) &= \tsub{\beta}{seas}(t) \alpha(t),
\end{align}
where $\alpha < 1$ corresponds to reduction in transmission due to intervention effects.
To constrain the smoothness of $\tsub{\beta}{seas}(t)$, we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{impose }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{imposed }\DIFaddend cyclic, random-walk priors:
\begin{align}
\tsub{\beta}{seas}(t) &\sim \mathrm{Normal}(\tsub{\beta}{seas}(t-1), \sigma) \qquad t = 2 \dots 52\\
\tsub{\beta}{seas}(1) &\sim \mathrm{Normal}(\tsub{\beta}{seas}(52), \sigma)\DIFaddbegin \\
\DIFadd{\sigma }&\DIFadd{\sim }\textrm{Half-Normal}(0, 1)
\DIFaddend \end{align}
\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \swp{I noticed that I forgot to put a prior on $\sigma$ so need to re-do this but won't change the results.}
%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{We fix }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{We fixed }\DIFaddend $\alpha(t)=1$ for all $t < 2020$ and estimate $\alpha$ assuming a normal prior:
\begin{equation}
\alpha \sim \mathrm{Normal}(1, 0.25).
\end{equation}
We \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{assume }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{assumed }\DIFaddend weakly informative priors on $\omega$ and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$\tau$:
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$\nu$:
}\DIFaddend \begin{align}
\omega \sim \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mathrm{Normal}(0, 200)
\tau }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \textrm{Half-Normal}(0, 200)\\
\DIFadd{\nu }\DIFaddend \sim \mathrm{Normal}(104, 26)
\end{align}
We \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{assume }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{assumed }\DIFaddend that the true birth/death rates, population sizes, and recovery rates are known.
We note, however, that assuming $\gamma=1/\mathrm{week}$ actually \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{correspond }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{corresponds }\DIFaddend to a mean \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{simulated }\DIFaddend infectious period of 1.6 weeks \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{due to a time discretization}\DIFaddend , which is much longer than the true value; this approximation allows us to test whether we can still robustly estimate the intrinsic resilience given \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{parameters }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{parameter }\DIFaddend mis-specification.
Initial conditions \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{are }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{were }\DIFaddend estimated with following priors:
\begin{align}
S(0) &= N s(0)\\
I(0) &= N i(0)\\
s(0) &\sim \textrm{Uniform}(0, 1)\\
i(0) &\sim \textrm{Half-Normal}(0, 0.001)
\end{align}
Finally, the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Observation model is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{observation model was }\DIFaddend specified as follows:
\begin{align}
\textrm{Cases}(t) &\sim \textrm{Negative-Binomial}(\rho N_{SI}(t), \phi)\\
\rho &\sim \textrm{Half-Normal}(0, 0.02)\\
\phi &\sim \textrm{Half-Normal}(0, 10)
\end{align}
where $\rho$ represents the reporting probability and $\phi$ represents the negative binomial overdispersion parameter.

The model \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{was }\DIFaddend fitted to four separate time series: (1) incidence time series from the SIRS model, (2) incidence time series for strain 1 from the two-strain model, (3) incidence time series for strain 2 from the two-strain model, and (4) combined incidence time series for strains 1 and 2 from the two-strain model.
The model was fitted using rstan \citep{carpenter2017stan,rstan} \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{with 4 chains, each consisting of 2000 iterations}\DIFaddend .
The resulting posterior distribution was used to calculate the intrinsic resilience of the seasonally unforced \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{system }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{SIRS model }\DIFaddend with the same parameters;
eigenvalues of the discrete-time SIR model were computed by numerically finding the equilibrium and calculating the Jacobian matrix.

\subsection*{Validations for window-selection criteria}

We \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{use }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{used }\DIFaddend stochastic SIRS simulations to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{validate }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{identify optimal parameters for }\DIFaddend the window-selection criteria that we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{use }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{used }\DIFaddend for the linear regression for estimating empirical resilience.
For each simulation, we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{begin }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{began }\DIFaddend by generating a random \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{intervention }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{perturbation }\DIFaddend $\alpha(t)$ from \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a }\DIFaddend random set of parameters.
First, we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{draw }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{drew }\DIFaddend the duration of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{intervention }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{perturbation }\DIFaddend $\tsub{\tau}{npi}$ from a uniform distribution between \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{0.5 and 3.5 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{1 and 2 }\DIFaddend years.
Then, we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{draw }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{drew }\DIFaddend independent normal variables $z_i$ of length $\lfloor 364 \tsub{\tau}{npi} \rfloor$ with a standard deviation of 0.02 and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{take }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{took }\DIFaddend a reverse cumulative sum to obtain a realistic shape for the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{intervention}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{perturbation}\DIFaddend :
\begin{equation}
x_n = 1 + \sum_{i=n}^{\lfloor 364 \tsub{\tau}{npi}\rfloor} z_i, \quad n = 1, \dots, \lfloor 364 \tsub{\tau}{npi}\rfloor.
\end{equation}
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We repeat }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{In contrast to simple perturbations that assume a constant reduction in transmission, this approach allows us to model transmission reduction that varies over time smoothly.
We repeated }\DIFaddend this random generation process until less than 10\% of $x_n$ exceeds \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{1.
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{1---this was done to ensure the perturbation term $\alpha(t)$ stays below 1 (and therefore reduce transmission) for the most part.
}\DIFaddend Then, we set any values that are above 1 or below 0 \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{as }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{to }\DIFaddend 1 and 0, respectively.
Then, we randomly \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{draw }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{drew }\DIFaddend the minimum transmission during \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{intervention }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{perturbation }\DIFaddend $\tsub{\alpha}{min}$ from a uniform distribution between 0.5 and 0.7 and scale $x_n$ to have a minimum of $\tsub{\alpha}{min}$:
\begin{equation}
x_{\textrm{scale},n} =  \tsub{\alpha}{min} + (1- \tsub{\alpha}{min}) \times \frac{x_n-\min x_n}{1- \min x_n}.
\end{equation}
This \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{allows }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{allowed }\DIFaddend us to simulate a realistically shaped \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{interventions}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{perturbation}\DIFaddend :
\begin{equation}
\alpha(t) = \begin{cases}
1 & t < 2020\\
x_{\textrm{scale},364(t-2020)} & 2020 \leq t < 2020 + \tsub{\tau}{npi}\\
1 & \tsub{\tau}{npi} \leq t
\end{cases}.
\end{equation}
Given this \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{intervention }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{perturbation }\DIFaddend function, we draw $\mathcal R_0$ from a uniform distribution between 1.5 and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{3 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{4 }\DIFaddend and the mean duration of immunity $1/\delta$ from a uniform distribution between \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{0.5 and 2.
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{1 and 4.
}\DIFaddend Then, we simulate the stochastic SIRS model from $S(0) = 10^8/\mathcal R_0$ and $I(0) = 100$ from 1990 to 2025 and truncate the time series to 2014--2025;
if the epidemic becomes extinct before the end of simulation, we discard that simulation and start over from the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{intervention }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{perturbation }\DIFaddend generation step.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We then apply the window selection criteria described in the main text to compute the empirical resilience and compare it against the intrinsic resilience of the seasonally unforced system}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin 

\DIFadd{For each epidemic simulation, we computed the empirical resilience by varying the threshold $R$ for the nearest neighbor approach from 4 to 14 with increments of 2, the number of divisions $K$ for the window selection between 8 and 25, and the truncation threshold $a$ for the window selection between 1 to 3;
this was done for all possible combinations of $R$, $K$, and $a$}\DIFaddend .
